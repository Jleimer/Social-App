# Social-App
This is a social media app where users can write thoughts, add friends, and comment on other users thoughts.
My app has the ability to add, update, and delete users. A user can then add, update and delete thoughts.  Other users 
can add and delete reactions to other users thoughts.  A user also has the ability to add and delete friends.  
This is application does not currently have a frontend.  I am using mongoose and on mongoDb along with CRUD operations to 
run this app and save information to the database.  Below is a link to a video walkthrough of the app.
